<p style="font-weight: bold; color:#8B0000;">"A National Study Among Diverse U.S. Populations of Exposure to Prescription Drugs with Evidence-Based Pharmacogenomic Information."</p> - with Loren Saulsberry

<br>

We use the Prescribed Medicine and Household Consolidated files from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey 2014-2019 to analyze trends and factors associated with the prescribing of pharmacogenomic medications. Using a novel dataset on medications with known pharmacogenomic associations, we identify persons with at least one pharmacogenomic prescription event and use this group as our primary sub-population for analysis.
